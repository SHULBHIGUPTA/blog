<li>Apple was very classic Silicon Valley startup in sense that Steve Woznaik worked for Hewlett Packard. In fact, Woz was
still working at Hewlett Packard when we started Apple and Hewlett Packard was the gensis of not just the concept to
starting your own company. Of course, it was primary role model in Valley. But it was also the ethics or ethical basis
of how you wanted to build your company? The company that was based on values and not just on making money and HP had
HP-way and had enlisted the values. The first one was we need to make profit or less we can’t keep this company going.
But after that values got into how they wanted to treat individuals conduct their corporate life and it was very
idealistic in my opinion. We were very much influenced by that. The second thing that made us very typical in a way was
that we were building a product that we ourselves were customer for. We were building something we wanted for ourselves
just like Hewlett and Packard started building test equipments and equipments for engineers. Well, they were engineers
so they could in essence do marketing. They could figure out what a engineer might want in a product as well as design
it. We wanted a computer and we knew exactly what we wanted in a computer and so we could do the marketing as well as
engineering of that product. This changed later as we started selling people that we are different than us but certainly
in first several years at Apple we were selling to people that were just like us. And a lot of Silicon Valley companies
have started that way.</li><br><br>
<li>One of the things that Woz and I did was, we built blue boxes. These are obsolete now. They were the devices that you
could build when you make long distance phone call and you hear the tone. Those were the telephone computer signalling
each other, sending information to each other to set up your call. And the signalling was like lot of phones but of
different frequencies. Well, you can make a box that emit those frequencies that make those tones. There used to be a
way to fool the entire telephone companies system that you were a telephone computer and to open up itself and let you
call anyone in the world for free. This was illegal but we were so fascinated by them. We built the best digital blue
box in the world and gave it to our friends. It was the magic that in fact two teenagers could build this box for $100
worth of parts and control $100 million infrastructure in entire telephone network in whole world. That was magical.
Experience like that taught us the power of ideas, the power of understanding that if you could build this box you could
control $100 million of infrastructure around the world. That’s a powerful thing. If we wouldn’t have made blue boxes,
there wouldn’t have been Apple. Because we would have not had not only the confidence that we can build something and
make it work, because it took us six months of discovery to figure out how to build this. It was tremendous process in
itself. But we also had the sense of magic that we could sort of influence the world.
