                <p>I called up Bill Hewlett when I was 12 years old. He lived in Palo Alto and his number was still in phone book and he
                answered the phone himself. He said, “Yes?” I said, “Hi, I am Steve Jobs and I am twelve years old. I am student in high
                school and I want to build a frequency counter and I was wondering if you have any spare parts I could have.” And he
                laughed and he gave me the spare parts to build the frequency counter and he gave me a job the summer at
                Hewlett-Packard, working on the assembly line putting nuts and bolts together on frequency counter and I was in heaven.</p>

                    I want to put a ding in the universe. Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking.
                    <br>
                    Start your business when you are young.
                    <br>
                    Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple.
                    <br>
                    We’re here to put a dent in the universe. Otherwise why else even be here?</p>
